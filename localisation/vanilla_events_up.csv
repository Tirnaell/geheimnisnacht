passover_accepted;You accept the invitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
passover_declined;You decline the invitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_500;Pie eating and revelry amongst family and friends is seen as the highest form of praise for the Halfling patron godess Esmerelda, the goddess of home and hearth. Every year, in celebration of the upcoming harvest, the Halflings of the moot celebrate Esmerelda's gifts by holding a week of celebrating and appreciating the simple joy of pie.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SoA_501;You have been invited to join your liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], at the Pie Week jubilee [From.GetSheHe] is hosting this year. The week-long celebration involves pie-eating contests, awards for the most delicious or most unique pie recipes, and general feasting and revelry.n\The holiday has understandably become one of the most widely celebrated aspects of Halfling culture and religious life outside The Moot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_501;How kind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SoA_501;Unfortunately, I have other plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_502;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused your invitation to the Pie Week jubilee, claiming [From.GetSheHe] has other plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_502;More for me, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_503;The Jubilee has begun, with pies of every variety and filling occupying huge tables in the banquet hall. Songs of home and hearth are sung in thanks to Esmerelda while rivers of beer and mead flow from enormous casks in the banquet hall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SoA_503;I hope I have enough room for seconds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_504;The jubilee of pies and drink lasts all day and night for the entire week, but all good things must end. Your vassals return home to digest, but most seem to agree that the pies and drink were worth the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

celebrate_passover_desc;While Halflings aren't seen to be an especially religious people, their only holiday of note, Pie Week, is notable for its near-universal observance among the Halflings of the Moot. If you invite the best pie-makers froun around the moot and invite your vassals, this year's Pie Week jubilee will be one to be remembered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
