ca_kraka_drak;Kraka Drak;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_kraka_drak_desc;Khazalid for Dragon Hold, the Norse Dwarfs of Kraka Drak have done much to earn their fearsome moniker. Said to be even more warlike than their cousins to the south, their entire society revolves around the virtue of war and the honor of battle, a necessary development given their location. This warlike demeanor has ensured their survival, however it has not been without a cost. Owing to their geographical remoteness, the foreignness of their customs, and the heterodox veneration of the ancestor gods as a collection of warrior aspects, they have become an isolated and culturally alien group to the rest of Dwarf-kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_praag;Praag;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_praag_desc;The fortress city of Praag is one of the few permanent settlements of the Ungol people, serving as their de facto capital, and the northernmost bastion of civilization in the Old World. Due to the city's unfavorable position, Praag has been forced to endure near constant raids by the Chaos-worshipping Kurgans and the savage Norscans for centuries. Though the majority of these raids are a minor inconvenience dispersed by raising a pulk of horsemen from the barracks, several networks of walls have been constructed concentrically around the city kreml with far more serious threats in mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_erengrad;Erengrad;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ct_erengrad_desc;Located where the river Lynsk meets the Sea of Claws, Erengrad is the most important trading city in the region of Kislev, and the second largest port in the north after Marienburg. Much of the city's wealth and status are a result of the lucrative trade in gems and silver with the more civilized peoples of Norsca, many of the goods eventually flowing from Erengrad to the Empire, or even further afield. Despite this enormous inflow of wealth, the city spends any spare coin constantly updating their defenses to the most modern standards, largely preventing Erengrad's burghers from spending on the frivolities that define Marienburg and the Tilea's trade cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_olricstaad;Ulric's Throat;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ca_olricstaad_desc;Ulric's Throat is the entrance to a vast cave system linking together the strongholds of the Order of the Winter Throne, the Ragnarites, a monastic order dedicated to an aspect Ulric known as the Snow King. The caves provide protection from the hostile Norscan winters and attackers alike, and are rumored to safeguard the Throne of the Winter King, an Ulrican holy artifact of unknown power. The order's members believe that it is their duty to prepare for the Evernacht, the eternal winter that Ulric will call upon to defeat the Dark Gods, ensuring their caves are always well provisioned with food, weapons, and supplies.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tb_ulfsland;Ulfsland;
tb_ulfsland_desc;Named after legendary hero Ulf Donnersson from the sagas of the Skaelings, it was told that after discovering the island that bears his name, he was made to complete trials of strength and endurance against a miraculously able old man. In the sagas, when Ulf won the trials, the bested old man turned out to be the god Ulric himself, who blessed Ulf and his descendants with the land as a reward for his skill and devotion. Ulfsland remains an important place as the spiritual home of the Skaelings, as well as a center of Norse political and spiritual life, even if many tribes have moved away from the worship of Ulric.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
