fearfrost_desc;Magically forged by Khan-Queen Miska, this sword is imbued with powerful ice magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_QUEEN_0;The Khan-Queen's Sword;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_QUEEN_0;This blade has been passed down through the ages from Tzarina to Tzarina, Mother to daughter, since Miska gave it to her daughter Shoika. In keeping with this time honored tradition, the blade is now yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_QUEEN_0;May my enemies fall as Miska's did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##The Erengrad Republic
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_0;Rebellious Erengrad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_0;The important trade city of Erengrad rebelled against their suzerain ruler in Kislev durning the civil war during the succession crisis several decades ago. While they have made no claims of being above the [Root.GetTitle], they have set a dangerous precedent for other would-be secessionists. Their continued refusal to submit willingly has only served to inflame tensions.\n\nWhile we are justified in launching a punitive expidition, the burghers may yet convince us to accept their pretense of self-rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_0;The rebellious burghers have defied my will for too long!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ERENGRAD_0;Their coin could make a very convincing argument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##What to do with the Veche
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_1;Fate of the Erengrad Veche;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_1;The center of Republican rule in Erengrad has long been its Veche, the seat of their burgher republic. As a powerful symbol of their popular rule, and the administrative heart of their republic, destroying it will break their will and discourage any further discussion of self-rule. However, allowing them to retain it will be seen as a gesture of the [Root.GetTitle]'s mercy, and will do much to cement their loyalty to the [Root.GetTitle] in Kislev.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_1;The Veche burns. Their defiance cannot go unpunished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ERENGRAD_1;The Veche shall remain at the pleasure of the [Root.GetTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##The Tzar/Tzarina demands a bribe
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_2;The Kislevite Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_2;The ignoble sovereign in Kislev has given us the option to pay a bribe or risk their might. While there is reason to believe that such threats are baseless posturing, a refusal still risks the independence of our Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_2;Our continued independence is worth a few coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ERENGRAD_2;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##Bribe recieved
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_3;Threats Pay Off;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_3;The burghers of Erengrad have agreed to pay us a hefty sum to ensure that they remain independent. While they are certainly not happy about being forced to part with any coin, our threat of our invasion no longer stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_3;I made them an offer they couldn't refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##Threats rebuffed
EVTTITLE_ERENGRAD_4;Erengrad Unmoved;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ERENGRAD_4;The arrogant burghers of Erengrad have foolishly denied your just demand. In response to your most humble request, the patricians of the city have replied only with insults and affronts to your dignity as their rightful suzerain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ERENGRAD_4;Their folly will soon be made clear to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
